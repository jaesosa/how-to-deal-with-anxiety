            Do you find yourself feeling anxious? With recent shifts in our routines, politics, and the world in
            general,
            <span class="topic">anxiety</span> seems to be affecting everyone, from the young to the old. As the above
            definition shows,
            <span class="topic">anxiety</span> is often unpleasant and manifests itself in our behavior. Unchecked <span
                class="topic">anxiety</span>
            can dominate thoughts and be crippling. What are some practical things you can do to cope?
            Consider some principles from an ancient book of wisdom:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <em>
                    Take one day at a time.
                </em>
                <br>
                “Never be anxious about the next day, for the next day will have its own anxieties. Each day has enough
                of its own
                anxieties.”
                <br>
                -Matthew 6:34
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                <em>
                    Seek the company of others when feeling overwhelmed.
                </em>
                <br>
                “Whoever isolates himself pursues his own selfish desires; He rejects all practical wisdom.”
                <br>
                -Proverbs 18:1
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                <em>
                    Get sufficient rest.
                </em>
                <br>
                “Better is a handful of rest than two handfuls of hard work and chasing after the wind.”
                <br>
                -Ecclesiastes 4:6
            </li>
        </ul>
